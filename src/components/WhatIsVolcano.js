        A volcano is an opening in a planet or moon’s crust through which molten
        rock, hot gases, and other materials erupt. Volcanoes often form a hill
        or mountain as layers of rock and ash build up from repeated eruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct. Active
        volcanoes have a recent history of eruptions; they are likely to erupt
        again. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted for a very long time but may
        erupt at a future time. Extinct volcanoes are not expected to erupt in
        the future.

      <p>
        Inside an active volcano is a chamber in which molten rock, called
        magma, collects. Pressure builds up inside the magma chamber, causing
        the magma to move through channels in the rock and escape onto the
        planet’s surface. Once it flows onto the surface the magma is known as
        lava.

        Some volcanic eruptions are explosive, while others occur as a slow lava
        flow. Eruptions can occur through a main opening at the top of the
        volcano or through vents that form on the sides. The rate and intensity
        of eruptions, as well as the composition of the magma, determine the
        shape of the volcano.

        Volcanoes are found on both land and the ocean floor. When volcanoes
        erupt on the ocean floor, they often create underwater mountains and
        mountain ranges as the released lava cools and hardens. Volcanoes on the
        ocean floor become islands when the
